				<p class="paratitle">Persona</p>
				<p class="paratext">Wang Ying is a 38-year-old architect. She has a son who goes to middle school. Because of the work requirement, she has to face computers every day. As a result, her cervical bone is injured. Although she complains about it a lot, she seldom actually do something to improve health because the measures she found on the Internet looks too complicated and she is reluctant to pay any time or energy to take them. </p>

			<p class="paratitle">Generalization of User Research</p>
			<p class="paratext">It is not easy to orgnaize logically from the conversations with users.  But they seem have many similar difficulities: limited time, limited energy and a little bit laziness after work. Most importantly, they do not see it as a big deal if it is not serious. <br>
			They want something small and delicated, helpful and customized. The product designed for them is demanding, since it is supposed to not only form the habits to lead a healthy life, but also require users' efforts as few as possible.<br>
			Since to form a habit is so hard, why not encourage users by gamification? This idea is formed.</p>

		<div class="table">
			<p class="paratitle">Prototype</p>
			<p class="paratext">Firstly, I decided to apply the "habit developing" model to make people live healthily.  Secondly, I think it is a good idea to help them engage in the product at any moment of a day by adding custimation module.</p>
